      "Over the past week, dozens of developers across multiple disciplines and teams shared their frustrations on Twitter. Death Trash creator Stephan Hövelbrinks explained that doors “have all sorts of possible bugs.” The Last of Us Part II co-game director Kurt Margenau called it “the thing that took the longest to get right.” How doors work is different during “combat tension,” when players are mid-encounter, vs. not, for example: doors slowly close automatically during combat, but remain open during exploration. “If a player is going to open a door, it can’t just magically fly open, the character has to reach to the doorknob and push it open,” Margenau explained in one tweet. “But what about closing it behind you?

      "A door isn’t exactly mankind’s best or even smartest invention in the real world. It’s a comically simple concept — open big rectangle for entry or exit — that in development becomes a team-wide problem. As Crystal Dynamics game director Will Kerslake put it in a message to The Verge, there are “so many issues with doors.” In one example, touching specifically on animation, Kerslake explained that doors can open toward or away from you; handles can be on either side. “If you can engage with that door from different states, like crouch or sprinting, then that’s an additional set of animations,” he says. “A door you pull open, requires you to back up in the real world to step out of the way, that’s another set of issues. In a first-person game you can animate the door and not the player, and this is easier. In a high-fidelity third-person game there is an expectation that the player’s hand will move to the handle.” And the players’ location and angle when they engage with any door can and will vary. \n",
      "Other problems might involve several players all scrabbling for a door at the same time, or even non-player characters. If a door hits an NPC, does the door stop, or does the NPC move? “The choices here can cause all kinds of bugs depending on your game,” says Kerslake.\n",
      "It’s not that making doors in a video game is an impossible task. For some developers, it’s just not worth the trouble. “As a result many games avoid doors in gameplay, you’d be surprised at how many games don’t have interactive doors at all,” says Keslake. “Lots of doorways, but the important doors are missing or already open. The next step up in complexity is doors used only as progress gates, they open only and then can’t be closed again.” \n",

The level of accuracy needed for a player to believe the door is a door is higher for a common object than a fantasy one, says Galbraith. \n",
      "“Our ideas of how we interact with them are incredibly clear due to the cognitive reinforcement we have received from interacting with them so often in a variety of different ways. For doors like the ones in our homes, we subconsciously learn the minute details of how they act, such as the rate at which they close or how much we can move them while they are locked. So when we see a door in a game that closes too fast or without friction or when there’s a locked door where the handle doesn’t jiggle and make a sound we’ll notice that something isn’t quite right about it.”\n",
      "You can still fib it a little. While most doors only go in one direction, for example, game doors will often swing either way. “When these sorts of virtual doors look, sound, and behave like regular doors, then they hit a level of mental acceptance with the player that allows the player to continue without questioning why every door in the game just so happens to open away from them,” Galbraith says. “To them it’s just a weird coincidence that the brain subconsciously chooses to ignore.”\n",
      "Doors aren’t just an aesthetic or immersion technique in video games; often they serve as part of level design.

       "  'fulltext': 'Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass platform received a huge boost with the addition of 20 new Bethesda Softworks titles across Xbox consoles, PC, and xCloud last week. And now, a quarter of those games are getting performance boosts on the next-gen Xbox consoles in a new update. \\nThe performance gains are in frame rate, thanks to an appropriately named new feature Microsoft revealed last month called FPS Boost, which can roughly double frame rates of older games using new Xbox hardware without requiring developers to do any manual work. \\nThe games seeing performance boosts with frame rate jumps up to 60 frames per second include Arkane Studios’ Dishonored: Definitive Edition and Prey and Bethesda Game Studios’ The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76. Microsoft announced on March 15th that the updates are going out that day. \\n\\nThe announcement was initially made during a YouTube live stream on March 12th between Xbox Live programming director Larry Hryb (aka “Major Nelson”) and comms chief Jeff Rubenstein, in which Rubenstein discussed the benefits the new Xbox Series X / S can bring to older Bethesda titles. \\nMicrosoft said in its announcement last week that “a handful of these games will also benefit from FPS Boost on Xbox Series X / S,” though it did not specify which at the time. it also said 16 of the 20 Bethesda games coming to Xbox Game Pass would be available across PC and xCloud in addition to Xbox consoles. You can find a list of which platforms which games are available here. \\nUpdate March 15th, 12:50PM ET: Added information from a blog post Microsoft published on Monday indicating the updates would be pushed live later today.

       "  'fulltext': 'Many current password managers allow you to share your passwords with family members or other individuals or groups. (You do use a password manager, don’t you?) Managers such as Bitwarden and 1Password have specific methods by which you can share passwords or groups of passwords, making it easier for a family to, say, access a shared streaming service.\\nNow Bitwarden has upped the ante by adding a feature it calls Send, which allows you to send files or text (including, if you wish, passwords) securely via end-to-end AES-256 bit encryption, using a link on its site. \\n\\nBitwarden Send generates a link and includes a number of security options\\n\\nHere’s how it works: If you wish to send a file (it can be up to 100 MB), you go to Bitwarden’s website and click on the Send button. After you upload the file, or create a text message, Send will generate a link that you can send out via email, text, or any other method you choose. When the person you send it to clicks on the link (and they don’t have to be a registered Bitwarden user), they are sent to a page where they can either view the text message or download the file.\\n\\nBut before you send out the link, there are a number of security features you can add. You can set a date and time for the file to automatically be deleted from the linked page (in other words, if you click on the link after that, you’ll be informed it’s no longer available) or for the link to expire. You can limit the number of times the file can be accessed and you can see how many times it’s been accessed so far. And finally, you can set a password for the link.\\nIf you’re using Send to create a text message, you can also have it be hidden by default when it is accessed (so the text is not immediately readable). \\n\\n Related\\n\\nThe best free password manager\\n\\nThe new Send feature will be only partially available to Bitwarden’s free users. Members with free accounts will be able to use it to send text, but not files, while those with Premium and other paid memberships will be able to send both text and files. \\nBitwarden is obviously taking full advantage of the recent reported exodus from LastPass because of the latter’s new limitations on its free accounts. Since there are already a number of free services for sending encrypted files, such as WeTransfer, and since having a secure way to send information such as passwords, personal information, and account numbers can be very handy, it looks like Bitwarden has given people another good reason to switch from LastPass. The new Send feature should be available Monday, March 15th at 7 AM.'},\n",

And when it is available, sales have been, for the most part, limited to online-only, with stock selling out almost instantly. Despite this, we here at The Verge are dedicated to helping you keep track of when and where the PS5 is available in the hopes you can get another shot at buying Sony’s next-gen console. \\nWe’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy either the PS5 (with a disc drive) or the PS5 Digital Edition, as well as any bundles that are not price surged. \\nKeep in mind that due to the high demand of this console, supply will not last long, with inventory selling out typically less than an hour after being made available. Nevertheless, we’ll do our best to keep this article updated with the latest in-stock alerts and tell you when the most recent restock was available at the retailers selling the console. \\n\\n Related\\n\\nPlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen\\nHow the PS5’s DualSense controller makes games like Fortnite and NBA 2K21 better\\n\\nWhere can I buy a PS5 right now?\\nDue to the pandemic, most retailers, including Best Buy and Target, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times in the week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart in particular. If you are looking for a bundle, retailers like Antonline and Newegg are likely to sell PS5 bundles instead of the actual console. \\nWe have noticed that restocks for the console are more likely to happen later in the week as opposed to earlier in the week. Additionally, places like Newegg are combatting the demand for this console by doing a Newegg Shuffle, which randomly selects winners interested in buying sought-after products. \\n\\nPlayStation 5 Digital Edition \\n\\n $400\\n\\n Prices taken at time of publishing.\\n\\nThe PS5 Digital Edition costs $399.

However, you might want to consider picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand-new console.\\nFirst, there’s the controller. Every new PS5 includes one DualSense controller.

The new sort by time-to-read feature, spotted by The Verge’s Dan Seifert, means articles can be organized where they fit best, whether it’s the five minutes it takes to microwave lunch, or a 20-minute wait for the late bus.\\nThe feature appears in both the search section of the app, and as a sorting feature in your main list. A reader can sort their saved article search by length, choosing from Quick (less than five minutes), Medium (six to ten minutes), Long (eleven to twelve minutes), and Very Long (over twenty-one minutes). Your list of saved articles can also be organized by newest saved, oldest saved, longest to read, and shortest read, according to Pocket’s VP and General Manager Matt Koidin. If the feature proves popular, after Pocket “modernizes its iOS codebase,” Koidin says the company will bring these sorting options to iOS and the web as well.\\n\\nI have wanted this feature in @Pocket for YEARS, thrilled it's finally a thing pic.twitter.com/Xpaxkz4awm— dan seifert (@dcseifert) March 11, 2021\\n\\nIn my pre-pandemic life, when I used to ride the bus to work almost every day, I’d constantly misjudge what I was getting myself into when deciding what to read.

Finding an article that can fit into a typical commute time might help people actually finish reading what they care about.\\nI assumed reading time was personalized, but Koidin says that Pocket actually bases its estimates on an average 220 words-per-minute reading speed. Now the hair on the back of my neck goes up when I think about great writing as a reading length first, rather than a holistic work of creative effort, but I think it’s easy to see how useful this could be (if I wasn’t shackled to an iPhone currently).\\nCommutes might not be in the equation for everyone just yet, but for those who still travel to work regularly, the feature might help.

       "  'fulltext': 'MetaKovan, the pseudonymous founder of MetaPurse, is the buyer behind the $69 million winning bid for a Beeple NFT at Christie’s yesterday. It was the third-highest sale price ever for a work from a living artist.\\n“When you think of high-valued NFTs, this one is going to be pretty hard to beat,” MetaKovan said in a statement published by Christie’s. “And here’s why — it represents 13 years of everyday work. Techniques are replicable and skill is surpassable, but the only thing you can’t hack digitally is time. This is the crown jewel, the most valuable piece of art for this generation. It is worth $1 billion.”\\n\\nWhat’s an NFT?\\nNFTs allow you to buy and sell ownership of unique digital items and keep track of who owns them using the blockchain. NFT stands for “non-fungible token,” and it can technically contain anything digital, including drawings, animated GIFs, songs, or items in video games. An NFT can either be one-of-a-kind, like a real-life painting, or one copy of many, like trading cards, but the blockchain keeps track of who has ownership of the file.\\nNFTs have been making headlines lately, some selling for millions of dollars, with high-profile memes like Nyan Cat and the “deal with it” sunglasses being put up for auction. There’s also a lot of discussion about the massive electricity use and\\xa0environmental impacts\\xa0of NFTs.\\xa0If you (understandably) still have questions, you can read through our NFT FAQ.\\n\\nThe $69 million NFT represented a collage containing 5,000 mostly digital illustrations from Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, that were created for his Everydays series, in which he creates a new artwork every day. Winkelmann’s popularity online and his prolific output surely contributed to the sky-high price, but a key driver was also the growing hype around NFTs.\\nMetaKovan previously spent more than $2.2 million to acquire 20 single-edition Beeple works in December. Though the works were purchased under an assortment of names, there was apparently just this single entity behind the acquisitions. The organization, MetaPurse, describes itself as a “crypto-exclusive” fund. Its first project involved building those 20 original Beeple works into a digital museum, then effectively selling shares of that museum as digital tokens so that a multitude of buyers can have a stake in these works.\\nNFTs are digital files that live on a blockchain and validate ownership of a related good — in this case, the collage. Some artists and collectors see them as the future of digital art by finally offering a way for buyers to acquire works that lack a physical component. Prices of NFTs from major artists have exploded in recent weeks, with Grimes selling $6 million worth of NFTs and Steve Aoki selling a single video for $888,888.88.\\nWinkelmann told The Verge on Monday that he expects to work with the buyer to find ways to physically display the collage. “Do you want it on a TV in your house? We can do that ... want to do it at Art Basel? Let’s project it on the side of a fucking building,” Winkelmann said. “It doesn’t have to be one way. It can be a bunch of different ways over time.”'},\n",

       "  'fulltext': \"Over the last decade, hundreds of newspapers have disappeared largely due to Big Tech’s disruption of the ad market. Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much when it comes to tech reform, whether it be content moderation or spinning off acquisitions, but they do seem to agree that local journalism needs saving. \\nOn Friday, a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing focused on the way Google and Facebook distribute news, and a new bill introduced earlier this week has already found Republican support. It’s one of the biggest legislative threats to tech that’s come out of the years-long antitrust debate, and much of its political force comes from the precarious state of local journalism. \\n“The crisis in American journalism has become a real crisis in our democracy and civic life,” Cicilline said in his opening remarks Friday. \\nCiciline’s bill, the “Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2021,” would allow news organizations to collectively negotiate with platforms like Facebook and Google the terms in which their content is distributed online. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who leads the Senate’s antitrust panel, also sponsored the legislation in the Senate and Republicans, like Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), have already signed on in support of the bill as well. \\n“This bill is a step in the right direction to dethroning those digital kings,” Buck said in his opening remarks Friday. “It is not a subsidy for outlets, but rather a leveling of the playing field in favor of democracy and free expression.”\\nBut while there was growing bipartisan support for the measure on Capitol Hill Friday, the real drama happened beyond the dais. \\nWHAT IT MEANS\\nThere’s more pressure now than ever for Congress to act. In January, Google threatened to remove its search engine from Australia, responding to a new law that would force the tech giant to pay news publishers for their content. That law was approved in February, and Google quickly backed off to cut a deal with News Corp. and other publishers. \\nWhile this all was happening, Microsoft put out a statement in support of Australia’s efforts to protect publishers. “One thing is clear: while other tech companies may sometimes threaten to leave Australia, Microsoft will never make such a threat,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in the statement last month. \\nSmith was brought in as a witness for Friday’s hearing, announcing his support for Cicilline’s media negotiation bill. Moments before the hearing was set to begin, Google put out its own scathing statement against Microsoft, suggesting that the company was “making self-serving claims” that could “break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival.”\\nGoogle has good reason to be afraid of this bill, especially in light of its Australia bluff. The Cicilline bill has bipartisan support, and its only the subcommittee’s first swing at Big Tech before they wrestle with more sweeping reforms. \\nTHE HIGHLIGHT\\nGlenn Greenwald, former Intercept editor turned Substack newsletter writer, also testified at Friday’s hearing. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) focused his line of questioning at Greenwald, asking if he feared a bill like the one proposed would only cement the power of larger media firms while leaving local journalism in the dust.\\n“The concern I have is that the discussion in the legislation seems grounded in a premise that the only or the primary problem, to both local and national journalism, is that Google and Facebook are vacuuming up advertising revenue and that you simply fix that problem the problem of media failure will be rectified as well,” Greenwald said. “I think that until the problem that this subcommittee identified in its report is addressed head on, which is breaking up the monopoly powers of this industry, none of these problems will really be fixed.”\\nCicilline went back at Greenwald, saying that his bill is just a first step. “The bill that, at least Mr. Buck and I have put forth… provides a temporary fix for a 48-month period. And in fact, anything these larger media companies would negotiate would be available to the smallest role newspaper in any city in town in America.” \\nHe continued, “We’re not going to do either or. We’re going to do both.”\\nWHAT DIDN’T THEY ASK?\\nAs Politico’s Cristiano Lima noted on Twitter, the committee hardly asked any questions about Facebook! Facebook had its own beef with Australia last month, removing the ability for some users and publishers to share news content in the country. In February, the Australian government agreed to several changes that would allow users to continue to publish news, so a thorough conversation on those concessions and how they could affect American users would have been beneficial.\\n\\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith's written testimony before House Judiciary today mentions Google 7⃣5⃣ times ‼️ By contrast, it mentions Facebook 3⃣ times— Cristiano Lima (@viaCristiano) March 12, 2021\\n\\nWHAT’S NEXT? \\nThe House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on antitrust still has another hearing before it starts introducing legislation. Those bills are expected to land this spring. Klobuchar also told CNN this week that the Senate’s competition committee will also start holding its own hearings on tech’s dominance, looking into app store fees and news publishing. Those hearings have yet to be scheduled. \"},\n",

       "  'fulltext': 'General Motors-backed EV startup Lordstown Motors has been accused of fabricating some of the 100,000 preorders for its forthcoming Endurance electric pickup and misleading investors, the public, and government regulators about how much progress it’s made in developing the truck.\\nThe accusations come in a new report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research — the same firm that published a report about hydrogen trucking startup Nikola that led to the founder resigning his position and a major restructuring of that company’s business. Hindenburg says in the report, published Friday, that it has taken an unspecified short position in Lordstown Motors, meaning it stands to make money from the startup’s stock price falling. \\nThe accusations from Hindenburg could also raise questions about General Motors and the due diligence it does on the startups it backs. GM, the biggest automaker in the US, had previously planned to take a big stake in Nikola before Hindenburg’s report came out last year. \\nLordstown Motors got big support from the Trump administration\\nGM has backed Lordstown Motors since its inception and has a seat on the startup’s board. It loaned Lordstown Motors $40 million so the startup could buy a plant that GM shuttered in Lordstown, Ohio — a deal praised by then-president Donald Trump that eventually led to a White House photo-op and then-Vice President Mike Pence appearing at the Endurance unveiling event.\\nGM also invested more money and made other contributions (for a total value of $75 million) to Lordstown Motors as part of its merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which turned the startup into a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq stock exchange and helped it raise nearly $700 million total. (The startup has since said it’s in the “due diligence” phase of obtaining a loan from the Department of Energy (DOE), too.)\\n“The $75 million investment from General Motors in LMC included certain in kind contributions that have already been provided to Lordstown. These include the plant itself. We have nothing to say about the report,” GM’s director of finance and sales communications James Cain said in an email. \\n“We will be sharing a full and thorough statement in the coming days, and when we do we will absolutely be refuting the Hindenburg Research report,” Lordstown Motors said in a statement late Friday. The DOE declined to comment.\\nLordstown Motors has claimed to have presold 100,000 pickup trucks to date. But Hindenburg accuses Lordstown Motors founder and CEO Steve Burns of paying consultants to preorder the startup’s electric pickup truck — something Burns confirmed to The Wall Street Journal on Friday.\\nThe firm claims multiple big-batch orders for the truck were from companies that either exist mostly on paper or don’t operate vehicle fleets to begin with. One order for 14,000 trucks — which would cost more than $700 million — was placed by a Texas company with just two employees on LinkedIn. Another order for 1,000 Endurances was from a similarly small company, the CEO of which allegedly told Hindenburg he had no plans to buy the trucks.\\nHindenburg also includes claims in its report that some preorders are nonbinding and require no money upfront, though this is a practice that has been common among startups in the space that try to book orders before getting a vehicle to production. \\nSome big orders came from companies that basically only exist on paper\\nWhile Burns has stuck to a September 2021 date for getting the startup’s pickup into production, Hindenburg says it spoke to former employees who believe the truck is at least three years away from being ready, including one who allegedly claimed that the startup has not completed cold weather and other testing required by the government. The report also cites a local news report of one of the startup’s prototype trucks catching fire in February as further evidence.\\nWhat’s more, Hindenburg discovered a previously unreported lawsuit filed against Lordstown Motors by EV startup Karma Automotive. In it, Karma accuses Lordstown Motors of trying to steal its infotainment system technology after initially trying to buy it.\\nLordstown Motors’ relationship to Burns’ previous company, fellow Ohio EV startup Workhorse, is also called into question in the report. Burns founded Lordstown Motors shortly after leaving Workhorse in 2019, thought Hindenburg claims he was fired. Workhorse did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nAs it entered into the deal with GM to buy the Lordstown factory, Burns’ new startup struck an agreement with Workhorse to license IP for a pickup truck that his former company was never able to get off the ground. Hindenburg claims that Workhorse was more than happy to unload the pickup truck. This deal has paid off handsomely so far for Workhorse, too, as Lordstown Motors paid $15.8 million for the IP, plus another $4.8 million when the new startup went public. Lordstown Motors also handed Workhorse a 10 percent stake that is now worth some $300 million based on the new startup’s stock price as of the end of 2020.\\nHindenburg obviously stands to benefit from any hit to Lordstown Motors’ stock price. The firm’s research into Nikola did lead to that startup performing an internal investigation, which turned up evidence that founder Trevor Milton did in fact make “inaccurate” statements about his company before he ultimately resigned. But Nikola claims the results of the investigation do not line up with Hindenburg’s accusation that that the startup is an “intricate fraud.” Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission investigations into Nikola are currently ongoing. \\nUpdate March 12th, 4:00PM ET: Added details about the Lordstown factory being included in the $75 million investment made by GM. \\nUpdate March 12th, 5:34PM ET: Added comment from Lordstown Motors.'},\n",

       "  'fulltext': 'This year, multiple companies primarily known for gaming laptops have been branching out into the portable business and productivity sector. It’s a crowded field already, but Razer made quite a splash with its excellent Razer Book 13, which has an elegant chassis, a 16:10 screen, and just a touch of its company’s signature RGB lighting. \\nIn this review I’m looking at the Summit Series, which is MSI’s attempt to enter the same space. The series includes the Summit E line — which includes discrete GPU options and is priced to compete with top dogs like Dell’s XPS 15 — and the Summit B line, which starts at $999 and sits squarely in the midrange market. \\n\\nOur review of \\nMSI Summit B15\\n\\nVerge Score\\n7 out of 10\\n\\nGood Stuff\\n\\nLightweight\\nNice businessy-looking chassis\\nGood 11th Gen processor\\n\\nBad Stuff\\n\\nDim display\\nNot-great battery life\\nMediocre speakers\\n\\nBuy for $999.99 from Amazon\\nBuy for $1,249.99 from Best Buy\\n\\nI’m discussing the Summit B15 here — I looked at the Summit E15 last fall. The base B15 includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. I tested the more expensive configuration, which costs $1,249 and has a Core i7-1165G7 (one of Intel’s top 11th Gen processors), 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. The system puts solid specs in a nice chassis, but there are a few misses that make it a bit expensive for what it offers. \\n\\nThe 720p IR webcam does not support Windows Hello.\\n\\nThat’s the fingerprint sensor in the top left.\\n\\nThe most appealing facets of the Summit-Series laptops are their look and build. They have a smooth black finish, an aluminum build, a classy backlit keyboard, and a lustrous new MSI logo on the lid and bottom bezel (no dragon to be found, a first for MSI). MSI claims the B15 has “military-grade durability,” and while that’s a difficult claim to test, there’s very little flex in the B15’s lid and keyboard. And at 3.53 pounds and 0.67 inches thick, it’s light for its size. \\nAll in all, though, the B15 has a bit of a utilitarian look, especially compared to the E15. The latter has some small flourishes that add up to a classier vibe — there are gold accents around the touchpad and edges of the hinge, for example, where the B15 is straight black. One other thing about the B15’s chassis — it’s one of the worst fingerprint magnets I’ve ever seen. Touch the lid one time, and a visible smudge will remain. I used the sides of my fists to reposition the laptop while taking photos and still had to wipe it down between shots. \\nDon’t get me wrong, it’s a nice-looking and nice-feeling chassis. But there’s nothing exciting about it, and you’ll be wiping it down a lot if you want to maintain a clean look.\\n\\nTwo USB-A and a microSD on the right.\\n\\n Related\\n\\nMSI’s Summit Series looks like it was made for the boardroom\\nMSI’s Summit Series are slim business laptops for remote workers \\nMSI GS66 Stealth proves the RTX 3080 can handle QHD just fine\\n\\nThe useful port selection is a highlight, given the thin chassis. It includes a USB-C (supporting Thunderbolt 4, power delivery, DP 1.4a, and USB 4.0), two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, one USB 3.2 Gen 1, one combination audio jack, one microSD reader, and one HDMI jack, in addition to the barrel-plug power port. You also get an RJ45 Ethernet dongle in the box, which is handy. I also appreciate having USB-A ports on both sides. \\nI also like the keyboard backlighting, which looks quite classy and wouldn’t be out of place in an office setting. The keys have a nice texture and 1.5mm of travel. Three nitpicks to note: First, the Fn key is half-sized, and I found it a pain to hit. Second, there was occasionally some internal rattle inside the deck, which was annoying. Third, the keys are more mushy than they are clicky, and they’re a bit shallower than the best keyboard keys around. Subjectively, I made more errors on this keyboard than I normally do. \\n\\nAudio jack, HDMI, USB-C, USB-A, and power port on the left.\\n\\nMSI Summit B15 specs (as reviewed)\\n\\nQuad-core Intel Core i7-1165G7 (1.2-4.7GHz)\\n16GB of\\xa0RAM (8G*2)\\nIntel Iris Xe graphcis\\n1TB NVMe SSD\\n15.6-inch FHD, IPS-Level 60Hz display\\nDimensions: 14.06 x 9.21 x 0.67 inches, 3.53 pounds (1.6 kg)\\nThree-cell, 52Wh battery\\n65W charger\\nTwo 2W speakers\\nOne USB 3.2 Gen 1, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, one USB-C (Thunderbolt 4, Power delivery, DP 1.4a, USB 4.0), one HDMI (4K @ 60Hz), one microSD\\n84-key backlit keyboard\\nGlass precision Touchpad\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIntel Wi-Fi 6 AX201 (2*2a ax)\\nBluetooth 5.1\\n\\nThe display, similarly, is functional with caveats. It covers 98 percent of the sRGB gamut and 76 percent of AdobeRGB, and it maxes out at 258 nits. That’s an acceptable range of color coverage and is functional enough for office use, but it’s too dim to use easily in bright settings. I would expect more from a $1,249 laptop. Additionally, it uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is falling out of fashion among premium business laptops for a reason — it’s cramped for multitasking purposes. \\nThe one component I really don’t like is the touchpad. It’s a bit small for a 15-inch laptop, and I sometimes hit the fingerprint sensor (built into the top-left corner) and the top plastic as I was scrolling. It also isn’t the smoothest I’ve ever used, and my fingers would skid across it a fair amount. Both the material and the click feel a bit plasticky compared to what you might find in a nicer model. \\nThe Summit’s performance is good. I didn’t encounter any problems while running it through my usual office work. The integrated Iris Xe graphics aren’t suitable for serious gaming but can run lighter fare if that’s your thing. I could occasionally feel the system chugging under the keyboard while doing more intense tasks, but it never got too loud or too hot. You can swap to the “Silent” cooling profile in MSI’s control panel if fan noise is bothering you. \\n\\nAGREE TO CONTINUE: MSI SUMMIT B15\\nEvery smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them, since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.\\nTo start using the MSI Summit B15, you’ll need to agree to the following:\\n\\nA request for your language\\nA request for your region\\nA request for your keyboard layout\\nConnect to Wi-Fi\\nWindows 10 license agreement and MSI’s terms of use\\nPIN\\nNahimic End User License and Privacy Policy\\n\\nYou can also say yes or no to the following:\\n\\nSign in with a Microsoft account\\nSet up the fingerprint sensor\\nPrivacy settings (location, Find My Device, sharing diagnostic data, inking and typing, tailored experience, advertising ID)\\nLink an Android phone\\nOneDrive backup\\nMicrosoft 365\\nAllow Microsoft to collect information (including your location and location history, contacts, voice input, speech and handwriting patterns, typing history, search history, calendar details, content and communication history from Microsoft services, messages and apps, and Microsoft Edge browsing history) to let Cortana provide personalized experiences and relevant suggestions\\n\\nThat’s seven mandatory agreements and 12 optional agreements to use the Summit B15.\\n\\nWith that said, two disappointments came out of my testing period. First, the audio from the B15’s two speakers isn’t terrible and works just fine for video calls, but it delivers tinny percussion and practically no bass. I also heard occasional distortion at maximum volume, though I could eliminate it by bumping the sound down a notch. My test unit’s microphone also wasn’t working on Zoom calls initially. It turned out Zoom had the wrong device set as the default input. If you run into this problem, clicking “Test Speaker and Microphone” before joining your meeting should resolve it.\\nSecond disappointment: the battery life. Running the B15 as my daily driver at 200 nits of brightness, I only averaged five hours and 13 minutes. This isn’t entirely unexpected, as it only has a three-cell 52Wh battery — similar to what some 13-inch laptops come with at this point. On this 15-inch laptop, it’s not enough to power you through a full day if your workload is similar to mine (around a dozen Chrome tabs, Slack, occasional Zoom call, that sort of thing). One thing to note is that the B15 comes loaded with Norton, which I’ve seen be a serious battery drain in the past. I ran a battery trial before uninstalling that software and only got four and a half hours. After I nuked the bloatware, the B15 got closer to six. \\nAll told, the Summit Series is a fine first step for MSI. In a market where business-focused laptops commonly cost multiple thousands of dollars, there’s absolutely an audience for something like the B15, which is light, attractive, and functional for just over the $1,000 mark. It looks and feels like a laptop you’d bring to a business meeting, and it has a top Intel processor with cooling that can handle it. Professionals on a budget could certainly do worse. \\n\\n“Determined to succeed” is the Summit Series motto.\\n\\nBut given the unremarkable audio, battery life, and the other areas of the chassis, I still think that people who are willing to spend a bit more will benefit from doing so, especially folks who can live with less RAM and storage. A better screen, better speakers, and better battery life can make a big difference in the daily experience, and while the B15’s nice chassis, plentiful storage, and business-specific features are worth a premium for some folks, they won’t be everyone’s top priority. \\nUpdate March 15th, 4:29PM: This story was updated to include a resolution to an issue that I initially faced with Zoom audio.\\nPhotography by Monica Chin / The Verge'},\n",

       "  'fulltext': 'Teaching AI systems to understand what’s happening in videos as completely as a human can is one of the hardest challenges — and biggest potential breakthroughs — in the world of machine learning. Today, Facebook announced a new initiative that it hopes will give it an edge in this consequential work: training its AI on Facebook users’ public videos.\\nAccess to training data is one of the biggest competitive advantages in AI, and by collecting this resource from millions and millions of their users, tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been able to forge ahead in various areas. And while Facebook has already trained machine vision models on billions of images collected from Instagram, it hasn’t previously announced projects of similar ambition for video understanding. \\n“part of our broader efforts toward building machines that learn like humans do”\\n“By learning from global streams of publicly available videos spanning nearly every country and hundreds of languages, our AI systems will not just improve accuracy but also adapt to our fast moving world and recognize the nuances and visual cues across different cultures and regions,” said the company in a blog. The project, titled Learning from Videos, is also part of Facebook’s “broader efforts toward building machines that learn like humans do.”\\nThe resulting machine learning models will be used to create new content recommendation systems and moderation tools, says Facebook, but could do so much more in the future. AI that can understand the content of videos could give Facebook unprecedented insight into users’ lives, allowing them to analyze their hobbies and interests, preferences in brands and clothes, and countless other personal details. Of course, Facebook already has access to such information through its current ad-targeting operation, but being able to parse video through AI would add an incredibly rich (and invasive) source of data to its stores. \\nFacebook is vague about its future plans for AI models trained on users’ videos. The company told The Verge such models could be put to a number of uses, from captioning videos to creating advanced search functions, but did not answer a question on whether or not they would be used to collect information for ad-targeting. Similarly, when asked if users had to consent to having their videos used to train Facebook’s AI or if they could opt out, the company responded only by noting that its Data Policy says users’ uploaded content can be used for “product research and development.” Facebook also did not respond to questions asking exactly how much video will be collected for training its AI systems or how access to this data by the company’s researchers will be overseen. \\nIn its blog post announcing the project, though, the social network did point to one future, speculative use: using AI to retrieve “digital memories” captured by smart glasses.\\nFacebook plans to release a pair of consumer smart glasses sometime this year. Details about the device are vague, but it’s likely these or future glasses will include integrated cameras to capture the wearer’s point of view. If AI systems can be trained to understand the content of video, then it will allow users to search for past recordings, just as many photo apps allow people to search for specific locations, objects, or people. (This is information, incidentally, that has often been indexed by AI systems trained on user data.)\\n\\nFacebook has released images showing prototype pairs of its augmented-reality smart glasses. \\nImage: Facebook\\n\\nAs recording video with smart glasses “becomes the norm,” says Facebook, “people should be able to recall specific moments from their vast bank of digital memories just as easy as they capture them.” It gives the example of a user conducting a search with the phrase “Show me every time we sang happy birthday to Grandma,” before being served relevant clips. As the company notes, such a search would require that AI systems establish connections between types of data, teaching them “to match the phrase ‘happy birthday’ to cakes, candles, people singing various birthday songs, and more.” Just like humans do, AI would need to understand rich concepts comprised of different types of sensory input. \\nLooking to the future, the combination of smart glasses and machine learning would enable what’s referred to as “worldscraping” — capturing granular data about the world by turning wearers of smart glasses into roving CCTV cameras. As the practice was described in a report last year from The Guardian: “Every time someone browsed a supermarket, their smart glasses would be recording real-time pricing data, stock levels and browsing habits; every time they opened up a newspaper, their glasses would know which stories they read, which adverts they looked at and which celebrity beach pictures their gaze lingered on.”\\nThis is an extreme outcome and not an avenue of research Facebook says it’s currently exploring. But it does illustrate the potential significance of pairing advanced AI video analysis with smart glasses — which the social network is apparently keen to do.\\nFacebook has deployed AI video models to recommend clips in Reels\\nBy comparison, the only use of its new AI video analysis tools that Facebook is currently disclosing is relatively mundane. Along with the announcement of Learning from Videos today, Facebook says it’s deployed a new content recommendation system based on its video work in its TikTok-clone Reels. “Popular videos often consist of the same music set to the same dance moves, but created and acted by different people,” says Facebook. By analyzing the content of videos, Facebook’s AI can suggest similar clips to users. \\nSuch content recommendation algorithms are not without potential problems, though. A recent report from MIT Technology Review highlighted how the social network’s emphasis on growth and user engagement has stopped its AI team from fully addressing how algorithms can spread misinformation and encourage political polarization. As the Technology Review article says: “The [machine learning] models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism.” This creates a conflict between the duties of Facebook’s AI ethics researchers and the company’s credo of maximizing growth.\\nFacebook isn’t the only big tech company pursuing advanced AI video analysis, nor is it the only one to leverage users’ data to do so. Google, for example, maintains a publicly accessible research dataset containing 8 million curated and partially labeled YouTube videos in order to “help accelerate research on large scale video understanding.” The search giant’s ad operations could similarly benefit from AI that understands the content of videos, even if the end result is simply serving more relevant ads in YouTube. \\nFacebook, though, thinks it has one particular advantage over its competitors. Not only does it have ample training data, but it’s pushing more and more resources into an AI method known as self-supervised learning. \\nself-supervised learning is “the dark matter of intelligence.”\\nUsually, when AI models are trained on data, those inputs have be to labeled by humans: tagging objects in pictures or transcribing audio recordings, for example. If you’ve ever solved a CAPTCHA identifying fire hydrants or pedestrian crossing then you’ve likely labeled data that’s helped to train AI. But self-supervised learning does away with the labels, speeding up the training process, and, some researchers believe, resulting in deeper and more meaningful analysis as the AI systems teach themselves to join the dots. Facebook is so optimistic about self-supervised learning it’s called it “the dark matter of intelligence.”\\nThe company says its future work on AI video analysis will focus on semi- and self-supervised learning methods, and that such techniques “have already improved our computer vision and speech recognition systems.” With such an abundance of video content available from Facebook’s 2.8 billion users, skipping the labeling part of AI training certainly makes sense. And if the social network can teach its machine learning models to understand video seamlessly, who knows what they might learn? '},\n",

And for every young person without internet access, there’s a “lost opportunity for new ideas and innovations that can serve humanity.” \\nThe breadth of the digital divide has come into sharp focus during the coronavirus pandemic, as people tried to work and learn from home, often on less-than-ideal internet connections. According to the Pew Research Center, in the US alone, only two-thirds of people living in rural areas have broadband access, compared to 79 percent of people living in suburbs. And the Federal Communications Commission’s universally disliked broadband maps don’t give a totally clear picture of the state of broadband access in the US. \\nBerners-Lee and Leith write that worldwide, the problem is similarly bad. “Only the top third of under-25s have a home internet connection, according to UNICEF, leaving 2.2 billion young people without the stable access they need to learn online, which has helped so many others continue their education during the pandemic.”\\nBerners-Lee and Leith also cite the need to protect young people online from abuse and misinformation, “which threatens their participation and can force them from platforms altogether,” they write. “This is especially true for those disproportionately targeted on the basis of their race, religion, sexuality, abilities, and gender.”\\nThe pair call for access to the internet to be recognized as a basic right, and they say the costs of making sure every young person is connected “is well within our reach. Through funding for network infrastructure, subsidies, and support for community networks, we can get the web into the hands of every young person on earth.” “An all-out push to connect the world will make sure that young people do not fall through the cracks.”\\nBerners-Lee says internet access should be treated as a basic right\\nBerners-Lee and Leith say that the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), an initiative of the Web Foundation, “has calculated that $428 billion of additional investment over ten years would provide everyone a quality broadband connection. To put this in perspective, that amounts to the equivalent of just $116 per person for the 3.7 billion people who remain offline today.” \\nProviding universal broadband access within the next ten years “would deliver around $8.7 trillion in direct economic benefits,” they write, citing a new analysis by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. “We can’t afford not to do it.”'},\n",

       "  'fulltext': 'Google and Microsoft engineers might collaborate on the Chromium browser code, but that hasn’t stopped corporate politics between the pair. Google has launched a scathing attack on Microsoft today, accusing it of trying “to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival.”\\nGoogle is upset about what it believes is an attack by Microsoft to undermine the company’s efforts to support journalism and publishers. In January, Google threatened to remove its search engine from Australia, in response to a law that would force Google to pay news publishers for their content. Australia passed the law in February, just days after Google caved and cut a deal with News Corp. and other publishers that ensured its services continue to be available in Australia. (Facebook, on the other hand, did remove the ability for users and publishers to share news content in the country, which earned some concessions from the Australian government.) \\n\\n Related\\n\\nAustralia passes law requiring Facebook and Google to pay for news content \\n\\nIn the middle of all of this, Microsoft was very public about its support of Australia’s new law, and it even teamed up with European publishers to call for online platforms to reach deals to pay news outlets for content. Google isn’t happy about Microsoft getting involved and this is the first big public spat we’ve seen since the Scroogled era.\\n“They are now making self-serving claims and are even willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival,” says Kent Walker, Google’s head of global affairs, in a blog post. “This latest attack marks a return to Microsoft’s longtime practices. Walker links to the Wikipedia entry for Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), and accuses Microsoft of muddying the waters to distract from recent security issues. \\n“It’s no coincidence that Microsoft’s newfound interest in attacking us comes on the heels of the SolarWinds attack and at a moment when they’ve allowed tens of thousands of their customers ... to be actively hacked via major Microsoft vulnerabilities,” says Walker. “Microsoft was warned about the vulnerabilities in their system, knew they were being exploited, and are now doing damage control while their customers scramble to pick up the pieces from what has been dubbed the Great Email Robbery. So maybe it’s not surprising to see them dusting off the old diversionary Scroogled playbook.”\\n\\nMicrosoft’s old Scroogled ads.\\n\\nThis unusual attack from Google also comes just as the House Judiciary Committee looks at the antitrust and commercial aspects of competition for a free and diverse press. Google argues it doesn’t make money from Google News, but Microsoft argues it’s a lot more complicated and involves Google Search ads, ad tech business, ad exchange, ad tech tools, and Google’s overall consumer dataset.\\n“News organizations have ad inventory to sell, but they can no longer sell directly to those who want to place ads,” says Microsoft president Brad Smith. “Instead, for all practical purposes they must use Google’s tools, operate on Google’s ad exchanges, contribute data to Google’s operations, and pay Google money. All this impacts the ability of news organizations to benefit economically even from advertising on their own sites.”\\nGoogle and Microsoft are clearly at odds over the core argument of whether publishers should have more control over a digital ad industry dominated by the search giant and Facebook. Microsoft wants Congress to move forward with the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act and “enable news organizations to negotiate collectively with online content distributors.” \\nGoogle, on the other hand, believes its Google News Initiative, where it tries to collaborate with the news industry, is enough to help news organizations. While Microsoft and Google battle in a war of words, the House Judiciary Committee is meeting today to hear less scathing arguments about the future of the press in a digital era.'},\n",

       "  'fulltext': 'It was a beautiful summer day in San Jose, California, perfect for pegging people with foam. My brother was particularly proud: he’d already been getting some great tags with his Nerf revolver, and now some guy had sold him a nifty 3D-printed cylinder so it could hold seven darts instead of five. I wanted one, too.\\nIt turned out the guy who sold him the cylinder, Luke, was mostly just there to say his goodbyes to the local Nerf group, before leaving the Bay Area for good. I didn’t think much of it at the time. I certainly didn’t know Luke Goodman was about to quit his day job to become the foam-slinging equivalent of James Bond’s gadget armorer Q.\\nLuke, better known as Out of Darts, went viral in 2015 when he figured out how to turn Nerf’s 12-round Zeus blaster into a 108-round ball-blasting contraption a little more worthy of the Greek god’s name. As many as 15 million people have watched PDK Films blow away an entire wall of Solo cups with Luke’s creation, after it got featured at Gizmodo and by popular Nerf YouTube star Drac (aka LordDraconical). \\nHe wasn’t yet out to build a better Nerf blaster; Luke was simply doing some irrigation work in his backyard when he realized the pipe he was holding might fit inside the Zeus. “I put a piece of it in there, pulled the trigger and just cackled,” he tells me. When he saw the YouTube numbers, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Then the emails started pouring in. Hundreds of people had tracked him down, asking to buy his “HIRricane” blaster. He whipped up a quick Etsy shop and got to work. But even at $160 per kit or $325 for an assembled blaster — an “absurd price” he set to see if it was worth his time — he still couldn’t keep up with the demand. \\n\\nNow, Out of Darts is at the forefront of a cottage industry selling original blasters and parts that can leave the official Nerf brand (owned by Transformers, G.I. Joe, and Magic: The Gathering giant Hasbro) in the dust. It’s almost something of an arms race, where the Nerf internet community one-ups each other by making their toy blasters shoot more foam faster, farther, and more accurately, whether to show off or to perform that much better in an actual game of Nerf. And while Hasbro is clearly taking some notes from the upstart maker community, 3D printers in particular are giving makers an edge they’ve never had before. \\nOriginally, Luke took the cottage industry part literally, selling blasters and parts out of his own house with just a few 3D printers to start. But today, he’s the proud proprietor of a 3,800-square-foot warehouse with eight employees, running a 97-printer factory that consumes over 300 pounds of filament each month. They ship nearly 100 orders a day to an army of hobbyists eager to build epic blasters of their own, customers who can now select from 1,500 different products including individual batteries, motors, and original 3D-printed parts. It’s gotten to the point that they needed to build a custom inventory picking program just to keep it all organized and let workers box up multiple orders at once.\\nHe now makes more money than he ever did behind the camera; enough to pay his shop employees an average of $20 an hour, too. He’s the first person I’d heard of to make a comfortable living from the Nerf cottage industry. But he’s far from the only one reshaping what a Nerf blaster can be.\\n\\nThe Little Rocket blaster with modular barrels.\\n\\nTwenty-four colors of filament are stacked and ready to use in the 3D printers at Out of Darts. They go through over 300 pounds a month.\\n\\nBlaster barrels produced in-house with 3D printers are organized by size and color at the Out of Darts warehouse and factory.\\n\\nA 3D printer produces original parts at Out of Darts. Out of Darts runs 97 3D printers to produce their original blasters and modification parts.\\n\\nIn the ’90s, Nerf was a simple game of tag you could play at a distance with your siblings, friends, maybe the neighbor kid down the street. You’d be lucky if you could afford a blaster that could shoot a single dart more than 50 feet, and that was only if you fired up at an angle praying it would land on target. There’s a reason the word “nerfing” means to weaken something — Nerf blasters were supposed to be safe for kids — but kids got wise. They’d cut off the tip of an arrow-firing blaster to make it shoot darts, plug safety holes with hot glue, and add rubber bands or bungies to make them shoot farther. Modding was part of the excitement of Nerf; you could bring anything you liked to the park as long as it wouldn’t put someone’s eye out.\\nAround the world, hotspots began to form — groups of Nerfers who pooled their knowledge and resources to host giant Nerf wars that could last days at a time. The internet brought them online, and the sophistication level of modders crept up from trial and error to actual science, discussing the optimal winding of an electric motor, the length of a barrel. Engineers who used to fling a few darts as children have realized there’s now an entire online community waiting for them to demonstrate what they can make foam projectiles do. \\nSteven Lawver was one of those kids who returned to the hobby as a science pro. Known as Captain Slug, he’s a modder who has, arguably, single-handedly transformed the Nerf scene twice: once in 2007 with his “Plusbow,” a DIY re-creation of Nerf’s legendary 1995 Crossbow (once considered one of the most powerful blasters in the sport), and more recently in 2016 with the Caliburn, a 3D-printed marvel. \\nProperly tuned, the Caliburn was one of the first magazine-fed blasters that could reliably and repeatedly hit things at a distance, with a beefy 11-inch spring and a robust pump-action mechanism. It used to be you could simply run toward your foes in Nerf, dodging darts on the way; the first few times I faced off against a Caliburn, I got pegged in the head and torso multiple times before I even got within range. \\nBut perhaps the real genius of the Caliburn was that Slug gave the files away for free, letting anyone print and remix the open-source plastic pieces themselves. He’ll build you a turnkey blaster if you’ve got the cash, sure, but he primarily sells packs of the metal hardware to folks who enjoy the mild challenge of assembling one at home. I certainly did:\\n\\nA traditional full-length Caliburn blaster, designed by Captain Slug.\\nPhoto by Sean Hollister / The Verge\\n\\nI bought the metal parts from Slug’s online shop, but a friend printed the plastic ones locally.\\nPhoto by Sean Hollister / The Verge\\n\\nNo readymade blaster ever offered that kind of performance until Slug showed the way. Now, they’re set to become a mainstay of sporting-grade Nerf, with companies like Jet Blaster and Dart Zone selling powerful, accurate rifle-shaped blasters for as little as $50 at Walmart. He’s even licensed his blaster designs to other shops; Worker, a quality Chinese aftermarket Nerf parts brand that increasingly sells blasters as well, cut a deal to mass-produce a “Worker Caliburn.” You can’t go to a modern Nerf war without seeing at least a handful of Caliburns, and forks off of the idea.\\nThere have been strong signs that Hasbro is paying attention and might want a piece of the action. In 2015, it launched Rival, a line of blasters targeting older players, advertising “high-impact rounds” that would travel at “70 miles per hour.” After Luke’s 108-round “HIRricane” went viral, Hasbro released two $100-and-up blasters with 100-plus round capacities, too. But the official Nerf brand has yet to release anything anywhere near as powerful and accurate as Captain Slug’s Caliburn.\\nLast month, Slug decided to quit his day job, too. He tells me he was already spending nearly as much time on his expanding array of designs as he did working at a material science lab, but blasters have become the bigger breadwinner by far: after producing over 1,500 Caliburn kits, 4,500 metal hardware sets and inking eight licensing deals over the past few years, he now makes over $100,000 a year from custom Nerf blasters alone. \\n\\nThe Out of Darts Jupiter blaster. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Out of Darts is nearly ready to bring a long-awaited invention to the world. It’s a next-gen version of the blaster that brought Luke his original 15 minutes of fame: the Out of Darts Rival Jupiter — designed in large part by his friend Tarik Crnovrsanin — and its companion Proton Pack, a device that can continually feed an incredible amount of ammo to a blaster through its swiveling tube. \\nEven by itself, the $99 Jupiter is an impressive sidearm, able to unleash a 12-ball blitz so fast foes don’t know what hit them. (That’s also partly because it’s so small.) I took it to a Nerf war before the pandemic hit, and I could tag out entire groups of foes at close range so long as I was willing to sacrifice myself — or lucky enough to find some cover for a rapid reload. But with the Proton Pack, it can live up to its Ghostbusters namesake: a nonstop stream of balls, only limited by the size of the ammo drum you’re willing to haul around. \\nI cram the entry-level 430-round hopper into my backpack, fill it to the brim with foam spheres, and seal it tight so the pressure from its brushless blower fan (and jam-busting auger) can feed them into the tube. And then, yes, I cackle too — as every single one of those 430 balls blast across my backyard from a veritable firehose I can hold in a single hand. Which in turn invites an obvious question: why not wield two? \\n\\nLuke Goodman with the Out of Darts Proton Pack and Jupiter, which can fire 20 rounds a second. He says he’s blasted tens of thousands of rounds through the system without jamming.\\n\\nThe answer might be the price: when Luke’s Proton Pack finally goes on sale later today (after teasing his customers for years), it’ll cost $165 for the DIY kit alone, not including a blaster or battery. If you want to pair it with a Jupiter, that’ll be an additional $99, though you’ll also be able to buy an adapter for some of the most popular blasters Hasbro sells — including the Perses, Zeus, Khaos, and Hera — just so long as you’ve got the basic soldering skills to rewire them. One financial consolation prize is you’ll only need one battery to power both: the Proton Pack doubles as a power source for your blaster, even sensing the current draw from your flywheels before it spins up its own motors to feed balls through the flexible swiveling tube.\\n\\nWhat the Jupiter and Proton Pack can do.\\n\\nOverpowered? Perhaps, but that’s the state of the Nerf hobby in 2021, where I see incredible original blasters appear at the r/Nerf and r/NerfHomemades subreddits on what feels like a weekly basis these days. The wide availability of 3D printers, powerful miniature motors, and high-power LiPo batteries has transformed the hobby over the past few years, to the point that seemingly unbeatable blasters are foiled by new inventions before long. “The first two games I just hammered people,” says Luke of his early Proton Pack prototypes, but his advantage didn’t last. “Two or three games later, everyone had Caliburns, and I’d get [tagged] before I stepped out from behind the tree.”\\nIt’s the next expansion that might be Out of Darts’ most ambitious yet. Though he hasn’t been able to visit China for over a year, Luke managed to find a genuine factory to start mass-producing his original products with actual injection-molded plastic. He’s starting small with a new dart magazine for existing blasters, but says that it might make more sense to invest in tooling than 3D printing for anything they’re likely to sell a few thousand of — for instance, their popular Rival Perses hopper, which expands the 50-round capacity of Nerf’s fastest blaster to 160 rounds while making it far, far easier to reload. (It also helps that it’s a large, difficult part to 3D print, but comparatively easy to mold.)\\n\\nThe Nerf Rival Perses, with Out of Darts’ 3D-printed hopper. \\n\\nLuke admits that it’s a nerve-wracking experience, waiting to find out if the first production run from a factory he’s never actually managed to visit will be good enough — each set of tooling can cost tens of thousands of dollars. “That’s why we hadn’t gotten into it yet; I wasn’t going to risk my whole business on a design,” he tells me.\\nThe not-so-dirty, not-so-secret dirty little secret of the Nerf cottage industry is that 3D-printed plastic isn’t very profitable, so injection molding is one way forward. Otherwise, metal’s where the money’s at; threaded rods, screws, and springs are the bulk of Slug’s business, and one-fifth of Out of Darts’ sales come from motors alone. With few exceptions, you could buy them from anywhere.\\nBut each business has amazing goodwill in the community, and it’s not hard to see why: they show up, time and again, with something new and exciting to contribute. Speak CaptainSlug’s name on Reddit, and he’ll often magically appear — sometimes to share progress on a brand-new design, sometimes just to shoot the shit or comment on your build. Another community example: FoamBlast, a rival parts business that also collaborates with Out of Darts, hosts a weekly Nerf news show.\\nWhen Luke’s not running the shop or answering customer email, he also spends much of his time on YouTube, filming remarkably high-quality video reviews and mod guides for Nerf’s latest blasters, often with parts he created specifically to make modding more accessible. \\nIn January 2019, I decided to try a high-power rapid-fire blaster mod with his custom parts instead of fiddling with hot glue, and was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was. For under $25, I bought some excellent hobby wire, a couple high-amperage Omron switches, and four 3D printed parts designed to perfectly mate those switches with a Nerf blaster’s triggers. A few hours later, guided by this step-by-step Out of Darts video, I’d turned my Nerf Rival Nemesis, already one of Hasbro’s more powerful designs, into a beast kicking out 9 balls a second.\\n\\nTarik Crnovrsanin (at right) holds two of his designs: a Proud Papa mounted atop a Jupiter. He’s a data scientist who also built the website and picker software for Out of Darts.\\n\\nAnd last November, Out of Darts collaborator Tarik surprised me with the accessory I’ve been secretly begging Nerf to make for years: a bolt-on blaster for your blaster, so you can shoot while you reload. He calls his $20 Little Rocket / $22 mountable Proud Papa the world’s smallest 3D-printed blaster, but it also packs quite a punch, firing standard Nerf darts with more power than many of Nerf’s own blasters at a fraction of the size. Better still, it’s got modular twist ’n’ lock barrels to quickly swap out a single long-range dart for a three-round spread or a shield-busting Mega. (Shields are a thing in some Nerf games, and the big red Mega darts are traditionally what you need to take them out of commission.) \\nIt’s exactly the kind of product that Out of Darts wants to be known for, Luke says: something the community wants, and that nobody had thought to create and sell quite yet. \\n\\nThese days, Luke tells me, he buys every single blaster from every brand as soon as he possibly can, to test it, figure out whether it’s going to be popular, and — if so — where he sees room for improvements he can make and sell. That’s where the easy-to-reload Perses hopper idea came from, and more recently, a mod for that powerful $50 Walmart blaster, the 125-feet-per-second Dart Zone Nexus Pro. “We have games that don’t allow blasters to shoot that hard, and some where we’d like to shoot harder,” says Luke, who started selling an incredibly elegant solution in no time flat: a “tuning cap” you can install in seconds to reduce or increase compression on the spring that powers your blaster. \\n“It was probably two or three weeks from the second I got the blaster to us having a product out,” says Luke, who credits the low prototyping costs of 3D printing with the fast turnaround. It wouldn’t have been possible with injection molding alone. \\nThere are risks to building your entire livelihood on a hobby predominantly controlled by a single company, of course. Nerf brand owner Hasbro discourages modding as a general rule, and when its entire 2020 lineup of “Elite 2.0” blasters turned out to be a cut-rate selection of poor performers that were hard for modders to open, he wound up with nothing to sell. \\n\\nNinety-seven 3D printers produce modification parts and complete blasters at Out of Darts.\\n\\nA few days after we spoke, Hasbro revealed its biggest Nerf news in years — a successor to Rival that seems likely to replace it entirely, and, I imagine, make some of Luke’s planned products obsolete. I hopped back on the phone with Luke, to ask him what he’ll do. To my surprise, he didn’t seem even a little bit worried. If anything, he seemed giddy — already full of ideas for the new Hyper lineup. \\nSure, he probably won’t make any more hoppers for the discontinued Perses, but he thinks a hopper might fit perfectly atop the similar Mach-100... should the community embrace the smaller (and likely easier to lose) Hyper ammo, of course. He thinks there’s more than enough Rival blasters already out in the world to sell the 1,000 Proton Packs he’s building, too. They’re out of Hasbro’s hands now.\\nIt makes me think back to the last big Nerf war I attended, where I saw more than a handful of Nerfers go into battle without a single scrap of actual Nerf-branded gear. The community has its own magazines, its own ammo, and is now regularly building blasters more powerful than anything Hasbro has ever put on shelves. “It’s Nerf or nothing” hasn’t been true for a while.\\nWhen I ask Luke what does keep him up at night, he says there isn’t much; perhaps just that he’s got seven employees whose livelihoods now depend on his business, too. There was a moment at the beginning of the pandemic where it seemed like everything would fall apart, the shop would be forced to close, and that would have been the end; he would have had to go back to shooting weddings and tech company videos. Instead, he closed for a couple days, switched most of the printers over to medical face shields for a few weeks, and that was it. The orders kept coming in. '}]"
